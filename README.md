___About the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center (Kids First DRC):___ 
The Kids First DRC is a collaborative, pediatric research effort with the goal of understanding the genetic causes and links between childhood cancer and structural birth defects. As part of the NIH Common Fundâ€™s Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program, the Kids First DRC is charged with:
- Developing data-driven platforms that integrate large amounts of genomic and clinical data from different disease types.
- Empowering the collaborative discovery, engagement, and necessary partnerships across disease communities that are crucial for progress in our biological understanding of diseases.
- Enabling rapid translation to personalized treatments for patients diagnosed with childhood cancer or structural birth defects.
- Accelerating discovery of genetic causes and shared biologic pathways within and across these conditions.
