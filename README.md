___About the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center (Kids First DRC):___ 
The Kids First DRC is a collaborative, pediatric research effort with the goal of understanding the genetic causes and links between childhood cancer and structural birth defects. As part of the NIH Common Fundâ€™s Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program, the Kids First DRC is charged with:
- Developing data-driven platforms that integrate large amounts of genomic and clinical data from different disease types.
- Empowering the collaborative discovery, engagement, and necessary partnerships across disease communities that are crucial for progress in our biological understanding of diseases.
- Enabling rapid translation to personalized treatments for patients diagnosed with childhood cancer or structural birth defects.
- Accelerating discovery of genetic causes and shared biologic pathways within and across these conditions.

___About the Kids First Working Group:___ The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program was initiated in response to the 2014 Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act. The program is overseen by the Kids First Working Group and Leadership Team with input from external scientific advisors. The four institutes that lead the Kids First Working Group are:
<ul>
<li>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)</li>
<li>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</li>
<li>National Human Genome Institute (NHGRI)</li>
<li>National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)</li>
</ul>
