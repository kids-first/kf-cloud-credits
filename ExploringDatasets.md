### Once logged in, there are many ways of exploring data sets

The [`Kids First DRC`]() makes many of the data openly available.  

The [`National Institute of Childhood Health and Diseases Center`](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/) within the [`National Institute of Health`](https://www.nih.gov/).

### Studies and Access

One way to familiarize oneself with available datasets and other assets is to navigate to the `Studies and Assets`

While phenotype information and variant information is available through the portal, access to genomic and other omic information may be controlled access.  

Access to these data require applying for access through dbGaP.   

Formulating the ones question for the access within dbGaP can help prepare the researcher for applying for computational cloud credits to analyze these data either with existing applications or with developing one's own workflows and performing interactive analyses with Jupyter notebooks, achieved through the application, Data Cruncher.


### Exploring Studies and Assets

Diving further, one can sees what other data are available by selecting [`Exploring Studies and Assets`](https://github.com/kids-first/kf-cloud-credits/blob/main/assets/ExploreDatasets.gif) from the main portal window.
