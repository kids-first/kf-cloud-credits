# Kids First Cloud Credit Program
## Closing Out Your Cloud Credits Project

### Wrapping Things Up 
At the conclusion of any project, cleaning up the workspace is an important final step. The same is true for your cloud-based research project. Funding provided through the Kids First Cloud Credits program will expire at the completion of the program and any CAVATICA projects supported by any of the provided billing groups will need to be addressed.

Users have two options for cleaning up their cloud workspaces funded under the Kids First Cloud Credits program.
- ___Establish a new billing group.___ Users can create a new billing group which draws funds from their own institutional accounts. This will support any further analysis as well as ongoing storage costs for hosting any of the output files generated as a part of the project. Once established, these new billing groups can be switched in for any CAVATICA project. Contact Seven Bridges Support (support@sevenbridges.org) for more information about this option.
- ___Export any necessary files for local storage and delete your cloud-based copy of any output.___ Any output files generated on the CAVATICA will incur billing charges to store. Users should review the files stored in their project and delete those that are unnecessary. Any critical output should be downloaded for preservation. Exporting the Kids First DRC's harmonized files (alignments, variant calls, etc.) is not recommended - these large files are hosted in the cloud free-to-users at any time. The Kids First DRC has two sets of directions for initiating bulk downloads from a CAVATICA project - one using [the Seven Bridges Command Line tool](https://www.notion.so/d3b/Bulk-Download-Instructions-567c7582ec1641d8b3f3659b746be831) and one using [a Python-based utility](https://github.com/kids-first/kf-cavatica-python-tools).
